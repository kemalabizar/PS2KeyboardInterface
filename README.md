# PS2KeyboardInterface
A customized version of PS/2 keyboard interface (hence it would be named C-PS/2), intended for use with future versions of Flyer-1. NOTE: This is unstable in high clock frequencies, it is best to run it below 256 Hz. May soon implement this as TTL, although I don't know how I'd manage it as of right now.
